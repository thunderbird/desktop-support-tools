# desktop-support-tools

Small tools to help Thunderbird support staff and volunteers troubleshoot
Thunderbird **Desktop**. Each tool comes as a command-line script and a matching
web page, in the style of
[thunderbird/dns-scripts](https://github.com/thunderbird/dns-scripts).

Licensed under [MPL-2.0](LICENSE).

## Setup

Managed with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```sh
uv sync
```

## parse_troubleshooting.py

Turns Thunderbird's Troubleshooting Information (**Help → Troubleshooting
Information → Copy text to clipboard**) into structured JSON describing each mail
account's incoming and outgoing server settings.

```sh
uv run parse_troubleshooting.py fixtures/thundermail-correct.txt
pbpaste | uv run parse_troubleshooting.py
```

You can paste the **whole** Troubleshooting Information or just the account lines
from the "Mail and News Accounts" section — both work.

Exit status is `0` when at least one account was found, `1` otherwise, so it can
be chained in a shell pipeline.

### Nothing personal is kept

Thunderbird marks the account and identity names — usually your email address —
as private data, and everything needed to check a configuration (server, port,
connection security, authentication method) is *not* private. So this tool
discards those two fields unconditionally, whether or not you copied with "Show
private data" ticked, and tells you when it did. Server settings are all it
keeps.

Nothing is uploaded and nothing is stored.

## Tests

```sh
uv run --with pytest pytest -q
```

Fixtures in `fixtures/` each have an `.expected.json` companion. These are the
shared contract between the Python CLI and the forthcoming JavaScript web page,
which will be checked against the same files.
